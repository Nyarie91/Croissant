    <h2>German Shepherd</h2>
    <p>
      The German Shepherd, also known in Britain as an Alsatian, is a German
      breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by
      Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from
      1899. It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. This is
      the cutest dog in the world!
